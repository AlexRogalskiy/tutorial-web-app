:enmasse: Red Hat AMQ Online

.Introduction

<<<<<<< HEAD
In a multi-application system, you often find:

* communication between the applications can be difficult due to differing technologies
* custom solutions can be difficult to create and maintain
* custom solutions require custom monitoring
* understanding the relationship between the applications requires deep technical insight to the overall architecture

A more structured approach involves:

* a simple integration that developers can understand intuitively
* simple provisioning and configuration
* built-in monitoring

This walkthrough describes how  to create such an integration, using OpenShift, Red Hat AMQ Online and API connectors in Fuse.

=======
In this walkthrough you create two apps (a Node.js app and a Spring Boot app).
Each app exposes a RESTful API that you connect so that they can share data without requiring coding or custom configuration.
The Spring Boot app is a CRUD app for fruit inventory, the Node.js app allows you enter a new fruit entry, which is then added as a record to the CRUD app.
This integration can be provisioned in minutes and is easily monitored and maintained using OpenShift {enmasse} and Fuse.
