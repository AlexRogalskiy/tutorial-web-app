      <p>In this tutorial you create two apps using Launcher (a Node.js app and a Spring Boot app). Each app exposes a RESTful
        API that you connect so that they can share data without requiring coding or custom configuration. This integration
        can be provisioned in minutes and is easily monitored and maintained using OpenShift, EnMasse and Fuse.</p>
